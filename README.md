Trends in Heroes of Pymoli:


The majority of the customer base is male.  Even if all of those who did not disclose gender were female, it would still be male dominated.  Females do spend slightly more per person, but the vastly greater number of males makes their purchasing power much higher.

The leading demographic of purchasers is from 20-24 in both purchase count and purchase value.  The secondary group in those metrics are the neighboring demographics of 15-19 and 25-29.  The data appears to be fairly normally distributed in terms of age.

Because there isn't a large discrepency in item price, the highest total value of sales is fairly similar to the highest purchase count.  There are definely a variety in purchase counts for items, but there is not an extremely profitable or popular outlier.
